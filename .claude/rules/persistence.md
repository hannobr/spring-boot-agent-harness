# Persistence adapter rules

Implements port interfaces from `internal`. Translates between domain models and database representations.

## Spring Data JDBC

Production code uses repository interfaces, not JdbcClient.

| Complexity | Approach |
|---|---|
| Simple CRUD | `CrudRepository` / `ListCrudRepository` |
| Simple filters (up to ~3 params, no JOINs) | Derived query methods |
| Complex queries (JOINs, aggregations) | `@Query` with native SQL |
| Batch operations, stored procedures | `JdbcTemplate` alongside repository |

JdbcClient and JdbcTemplate are allowed in production code only for batch/stored-proc use cases, and in test fixture setup code.

## Entity mapping

Use static factory methods on records. Direction: toward domain at inbound, away from domain at outbound.

```java
@Table("orders")
public record OrderEntity(@Id Long id, String customerId, String status) {
    public static OrderEntity from(Order order) { /* domain -> entity */ }
    public Order toDomain() { /* entity -> domain */ }
}
```

- Simple entities: `@Table`/`@Id`/`@Column` annotations on the persistence entity record.
- When domain model is simple and team accepts it: Spring Data JDBC can work directly with annotated domain types.
- Switch to separate persistence entity when: schema diverges from domain, multiple adapters, complex aggregates needing flattening.
- For 10+ fields or conditional logic: dedicated `<Entity>Mapper` utility class (final, static methods, one per aggregate root).

## Schema management — Flyway

All schema changes are managed by Flyway migrations. Never use `schema.sql` for DDL.

- Migrations live in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- Naming: `V{n}__description.sql` (double underscore, snake_case description, e.g., `V1__create_orders_table.sql`)
- Never edit a migration that has been applied — always create a new one
- Use PostgreSQL-native types: `BIGSERIAL` for auto-generated IDs, `TEXT` for unbounded strings, `TIMESTAMPTZ` for timestamps
- Use lowercase column names in DDL — Spring Data JDBC quotes identifiers, and PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for quoted identifiers

## PostgreSQL + Spring Data JDBC notes

- `BIGSERIAL` maps to `Long` with `@Id` — PostgreSQL handles auto-increment via sequences
- Spring Data JDBC treats entities with non-null `@Id` as existing (triggers UPDATE). For pre-assigned IDs, add `@Version Integer version` (pass `null` for new entities)
- PostgreSQL does not auto-uppercase identifiers (unlike H2) — use lowercase consistently in DDL and `@Table`/`@Column` annotations

## Error handling

Wrap infrastructure exceptions only when they have domain meaning:

```java
try { return repository.save(order); }
catch (DuplicateKeyException e) { throw new OrderAlreadyExistsException(order.id()); }
// Let other DataAccessExceptions propagate to the catch-all handler
```

## Aggregate save behaviour

`repository.save()` on an aggregate with child collections does DELETE ALL + INSERT ALL for children on every save. This is by design — the aggregate is the consistency boundary. If this causes performance problems, the aggregate is too large — split it.

## What NOT to do

- No mapping in domain or application code. Domain does not know about entities or DTOs.
- No passing DTOs through use cases. Convert to domain types at the boundary.
- No shared mapper modules across adapters. Each adapter owns its mapping.
