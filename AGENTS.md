# Codex Contract

This repository is an agent-first template for Java 25 / Spring Boot 4 backends built around Spring Modulith, Spring Data JDBC, Flyway, PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, and deterministic validation.

This file is the Codex entrypoint. It is additive to the existing Claude setup in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and `.claude/`. Do not edit, remove, or contradict the Claude files when working from this Codex layer.

## Start Here
- Read [README.md](README.md) for onboarding, quick-start commands, and the current template surface.
- Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current code, runtime, and validation topology.
- Read [Design Docs Index](docs/design-docs/index.md) for the durable Codex-facing knowledge map.
- Read [ADR-001-v2-agent-first-modularity.md](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-001-v2-agent-first-modularity.md) for the governing architecture decision.
- Read [LEARNINGS.md](docs/learnings/LEARNINGS.md) before working in areas with framework, testing, or build-tool gotchas.
- Read [PLANS.md](docs/PLANS.md) before creating or updating durable execution plans.
- Use [docs/exec-plans/active](docs/exec-plans/active) and [docs/exec-plans/completed](docs/exec-plans/completed) as the durable work log for non-trivial changes.

## Canonical Commands
Preferred Codex harness entrypoints:
- `scripts/harness/fast-check`
- `scripts/harness/full-check`
- `scripts/harness/run-app`
- `scripts/harness/smoke-startup`
- `scripts/harness/doc-lint`
- `scripts/harness/new-exec-plan`
- `scripts/harness/new-module`

Underlying repo commands:
- `./mvnw -q compile`
- `./mvnw -q test`
- `./mvnw -q verify`
- `docker compose up -d`
- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- `./mvnw spotless:apply`
- `./mvnw spotless:check`

Docker is required for tests and local development. Local development uses `docker compose`, while tests use Testcontainers. In sandboxed environments, `docker compose` may need the documented manual `docker run` fallback, and SpotBugs may require `-Dspotbugs.skip=true`.

## Working Rules
- Treat top-level packages under `nl.jinsoo.template` as business modules. The root package of a module is its public API; `internal/`, `persistence/`, and `rest/` are hidden implementation details.
- Keep current architectural constraints intact: Spring Data JDBC only, Flyway-only schema changes, no JPA, no mapping frameworks, constructor injection only, thin controllers, and framework-free domain/use-case code.
- Every `package-info.java` must have `@org.jspecify.annotations.NullMarked`. Use `@Nullable` only where null is genuinely part of the contract. NullAway enforces at compile time.
- Use the current test pyramid and Spring Boot 4 testing APIs. Do not regress to deprecated patterns such as `@MockBean`, `TestRestTemplate`, raw `MockMvc`, or embedded H2 shortcuts.
- Never commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- When a path-local `AGENTS.md` exists, it refines these root rules for its subtree.

## Transaction Boundaries
- Every public method on a Facade or Service class (the module API implementation) must have `@Transactional`. Write methods get `@Transactional`, read methods get `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- **Never put `@Transactional` on UseCase classes.** Use cases are plain Java objects created with `new` in `@Configuration` classes — Spring AOP does not intercept them, so the annotation is silently ignored.
- The Facade/Service is the Spring bean (returned from `@Bean`), so `@Transactional` works there.
- Import: `org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional` (not `jakarta.transaction.Transactional`).
- Enforced by the `moduleApiImplementationsMustHaveTransactionalMethods` ArchUnit rule — the build fails if a method is missing the annotation.

## Planning And Durable Memory
- For multi-file or architectural work, persist the approved plan in [docs/exec-plans/active](docs/exec-plans/active) before editing. If the work spans multiple plans, create the `EPIC-NNNN` file first.
- Keep plan files current: update checklist state, append decision-log entries for meaningful trade-offs, and record tech debt when introduced.
- Move completed plans from `active/` to `completed/` when their work is actually finished.
- Add or update learnings in [LEARNINGS.md](docs/learnings/LEARNINGS.md) when framework behavior, tool behavior, or debugging effort reveals reusable repo knowledge.

## Completion Criteria
- Every production change must be backed by the appropriate tests for its layer.
- `./mvnw -q verify` is the mandatory final validation command.
- After `verify`, confirm runtime startup with `docker compose up -d && ./mvnw spring-boot:run` and wait for a successful start.
- Keep Codex-facing docs aligned with the same standards already configured for Claude; the Codex layer must not weaken the existing architecture, planning, or validation rules.
